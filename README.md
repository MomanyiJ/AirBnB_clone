First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because I  will use what I build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will hep:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
